# bamazon-CLI-app

## Overview
This app is an Amazon-like storefront built with Node.js and MySQL. The customer app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The manager app will display all of the items listed for sale, display only the items with low inventory, add stock quantity to current listings, and add new product to the listing.

## How to run
* Customer App 
   node bamazonCustomer.js

* Manager App
